# SafeStreets
SafeStreets is a replica of an app which is currently in use in one state, but our application is the better version of it with added few more features.
# Why crime reporting platform needed?
Currently, there is a lack of a unified and efficient platform for community members to report crimes and access important emergency contact numbers in a timely manner. Furthermore, there is a need for a platform that not only provides a means for reporting crimes, but also empowers the community by displaying real-time statistics and movable news articles related to crime incidents.
Additionally, there is a need for a system which allows the person to lodge online FIR because what if the victim is afraid to go out or could be any reason. Also there is no website or app which have a complaint section on the platform where community members can initiate discussions and vote on complaints lodged, which will confirm that the complaint is genuine or fake.
